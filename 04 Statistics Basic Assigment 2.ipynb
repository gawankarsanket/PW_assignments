    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to quantify the spread or\n",
    "variability of a dataset. They provide valuable information about how the data points are distributed around\n",
    "the central value (mean or median). Understanding the spread of the data is crucial in analyzing and \n",
    "interpreting datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "   The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum \n",
    "   values in a dataset.\n",
    "   The range gives a basic idea of the spread of the data. However, it is sensitive to outliers and may not fully \n",
    "   capture the distribution's characteristics.\n",

    "Range = Maximum value - Minimum value = 35 - 24 = 11\n",
    "The range in this case is 11, indicating that the ages vary by 11 years.\n",

    "Variance:\n",
    "         Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies \n",

    "         Variance provides a more comprehensive measure of the spread, considering all data points and their \n",
    "         distances from the mean. A higher variance indicates greater variability.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         Example: Using the same dataset of ages, let's calculate the variance:\n",
    "         \n",
    "         Mean = (25 + 30 + 28 + 26 + 32 + 27 + 29 + 24 + 31 + 35) / 10 = 29.7 (approximately)\n",
    "         Variance = [(25 - 29.7)² + (30 - 29.7)² + ... + (35 - 29.7)²] / 10 ≈ 18.66\n",
    "         \n",
    "         The variance is approximately 18.66, representing the average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "        The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a more interpretable measure of \n",
    "        spread in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "        The standard deviation is widely used as a measure of spread due to its direct comparability with the \n",
    "        original data. A larger standard deviation indicates higher variability.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Example: Using the same dataset of ages, let's calculate the standard deviation:\n",
