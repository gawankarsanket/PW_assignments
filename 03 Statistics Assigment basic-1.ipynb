    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In statistics, measures of central tendency and measures of variability are used to describe \n",
    "the central values and spread of a dataset, respectively. \n",
    "These measures provide valuable insights into the distribution of data and help in understanding \n",
    "the overall characteristics of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. It is the arithmetic average of \n",
    "all the data points in a dataset. \n",
    "To calculate the mean, you add up all the values and divide by the number of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the dataset of exam scores: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90. \n",
    "The mean is (70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 80. \n",
    "This value indicates the average performance of the students in the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. \n",
    "It is not influenced by extreme values or outliers and is useful for describing datasets with skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For the dataset of exam scores mentioned earlier, when arranged in ascending order, \n",
    "we have: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90. The median is the middle value, which is 80. \n",
    "This represents the middle performance in the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. \n",
    "A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). \n",
    "It is helpful when describing categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the dataset of exam scores, all values occur only once, so there is no mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the simplest measure of variability and represents the difference between the maximum\n",
    "and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For the dataset of exam scores (70, 75, 80, 85, 90), the range is 90 - 70 = 20. \n",
    "This indicates that the scores vary by 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It quantifies the spread of data \n",
    "points from the mean. A larger variance indicates more dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For the dataset of exam scores, the variance might be calculated as follows:\n",
    "Variance = [(70 - 80)² + (75 - 80)² + (80 - 80)² + (85 - 80)² + (90 - 80)²] / 5 ≈ 50\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a more \n",
    "interpretable measure of variability, as it is in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For the dataset of exam scores, the standard deviation ≈ √50 ≈ 7.07. \n",
    "This indicates that, on average, the scores deviate by approximately 7.07 points from the mean.\n",
    "Measures of central tendency and variability are crucial in summarizing and describing datasets. \n",
    "They help researchers and analysts understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and make \n",
    "informed decisions based on the characteristics of the data.\n",
